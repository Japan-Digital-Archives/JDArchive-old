            <li><p>Use this simple script to do a search on URLs and Titles of seeds in our database.<br /><br />
			When searching for a URL, anything <em>beginning</em> with the search term will be returned. When searching in the title of the seed, any title which contains the search term will be returned.<br /><br />
			The returned results will show the title, which links to the curation edit page for that seed and the url for the seed which links to the original site. The script currently limits search results to the first 400 hits. <br /><br /> - Konrad</p></li>
