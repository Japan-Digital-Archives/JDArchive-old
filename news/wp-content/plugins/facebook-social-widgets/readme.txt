== Description ==

Fully customizable widgets ( not just iframe includes ).

Social plugins enable you to provide engaging social experiences to your users with the flexibility of widgets. Because they are hosted by Facebook, the widgets are personalized for all users who are logged into Facebook â€” even if the users haven't yet signed up for your site.

All widgets use the XFBML; so, expect added features.
